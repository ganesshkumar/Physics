##Atoms in Motion##
###1.1 Introduction###

__Principle of Science__: _The test of all knowledge is experiment_

###1.2 Matter is made of atoms###

__Atomic hypothesis:__ _All things are made of atoms - little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repellingupon being squeezed into one another_

In water, the water molecules are held together by the attraction between each and every water molecules(that are closer). This results in the motion of water molecules. 

When water is heated, the molecules start moving faster and the inter-molecular space increases. At boiling point they inter-molecular is so much that they fly away from each other forming steam.

When water is cooled, they motion of the molecules slows down and gets locked into a pattern, thus forming ice.

>At absolute zero, the atoms will have miminum amount of vibration the atoms can have, but not zero

In a closed container filled with gas atoms,

* Pressure varies directly to the density of the atoms
* Pressure varies directly to the temperature of the gas
