####1.1 Introduction####

__Principle of Science__: _The test of all knowledge is experiment_

###1.2 Matter is made of atoms###

__Atomic hypothesis:__ _All things are made of atoms - little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another_

In water, the water molecules are held together by the attraction between each and every water molecules(that are closer). This results in the motion of water molecules. `qwert`

When water is heated, the molecules start moving faster and the inter-molecular space increases. At boiling point they inter-molecular is so much that they fly away from each other forming steam.

When water is cooled, they motion of the molecules slows down and gets locked into a pattern, thus forming ice.

>At absolute zero, the atoms will have miminum amount of vibration the atoms can have, but not zero

In a closed container filled with gas atoms,

* Pressure varies directly to the density of the atoms
* Pressure varies directly to the temperature of the gas

###1.3 Atomic processes###

__Evaporation of water__: The molecules in water are always jiggling around. At times, one on the surface of the water are hit little harder and it gets knocked away. Slowly, molecules disappear one by one - it evaporates. There will be few water molecules in the air that come and get stuck to the water surface. 

If we heat the water, the molecules start jiggling faster and thus more molecules will leave the sureface of the water than those that get stuck onto the surface of the water ie the rate a which molecules leave water is faster than the rate at which molecules come back to water surface. So the evaporation is observed.

__NaCl dissolving in water__: Sodium chloride(NaCl) is a tightly packed crystal of Na+ and Cl- ions. When we put the salt in water, water molecules take away few ions on the surface. The reverse process of ions in water getting stuck onto the sureface of the salf also happens. When the rate of the former process is greater than the latter, we observe the salt dissolving in water. 

When the water is heated, the process of salt dissolving in water happens faster, as water molecules will be moving faster.

###1.4 Chemical reaction###

>The process in which the rearrangement of atomic pattern occurs is called a __chemical reaction__

__Burning of carbon in oxygen__: When carbon(solid crystal) in burned in oxygen, each oxygen atom in oxygen molecule combines with a carbon atom to form carbon monoxide. The combination is so vigorous that everything around them will pick up energy. Thus kinetic energy is generated. This is called `burning`. The heat felt is due to the motion of hot gas. In certain circumstances the energy is so enormous that light is also generated.

The carbon monoxide(CO) formed may combine with one of the atoms in oxygen molecule to from carbon dioxide. Usually, rapid burning under limited supply of oxygen(as in engine etc) will produce more CO. 


#Basic Physics#

###2.1 Introduction###
> Observation, reason and experiment make up what we call the scientific method

###Physics before 1920###

* Space is a three dimension space of geometry changing in a medium called time.
* Two basic properties of particles:
  * **Property of inertia**: If a particle is moving, it keeps on moving in the same direction unless acted upon by some force
  * **Force**: 1. Short ranged stronger force  2. Long ranged, smooth and quiet attraction force that varies inversely as the square of distance
* 92 kinds of atom
* Picture of Atom
  * Nucleus - positive charge
  * Electrons - negative charge
  * Nucleus has protons(light weight and positively charged) and neutrons(heavy and neutral)
  * Number of protons and electons are equal
* Discovery of **elctric field**
  * charges create field in space
  * charges in field experience force and move
* Changing electric field produced magnetism
* Elecomagnetic field carry the wave
